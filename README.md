## Purpose - Golang Proof of Concept
This is a repository for practicing with the Go Programming Language. The main idea is to cover
a wide range of topics and difficulties, with focus on algorithms and the exercises listed in the
book "The Go Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Alan Donovan. Additionaly, because in Go
we can deal with pointers directly, it will provide a nice interface to practice algorithms and
data structures.


## Environment
All of the examples here were run using with the Go version 1.20.8. More specifically, everything
was run inside a Docker container, using the Docker image `golang:1.20-alpine` which is a really
lightweight linux distribution.
